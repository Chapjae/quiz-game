AS A coding boot camp student <br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores <br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Usage ##

This game consists of a series of random trivia questions that will display to the user along with a list of 4 possible answers. The user will read the question, and then select an option that they think is the correct answer to that question. The game will display a response to the user letting them know if their answer was correct and if so, increase their score by 1. If not, it will subtract 15 seconds from their remaining time. Once the timer reaches 0 the game will end and the user will be prompted to enter their score into the "Hall of Fame."
